\section*{Motivation and problems to solve}

A project needs to deliver fast business value, be technically feasible and desirable by the end user \citep{ratcliffe2011agile:11}. \newline
To solve this problem, the agile movement came up with many ideas, such as splitting the workload into smaller chunks, to tackle these tasks. But they came at a cost. Integrating the agile manifest meant, that all members of the project and the Client had to commit to it \citep{ratcliffe2011agile:11}. Theirfore a big share of all Web Agencies kept parts of the original waterfall phases in their processes \citep{10spanne26:online}. This lead to stiff deadlines which had to be met by an agile team of developers and sometimes also designers \citep{ratcliffe2011agile:4}. \newline
Additionally there is a different strategy out there, that claims to solve similiar problems such as agile. Human Computer Interaction (HCI) methods to create a feasible design concept are also used. \newline
Still more often than not, the end user is only kept in mind during early concepting. After the solutions are sketched, wireframed or mocked up, there is little to no discussion, if the final product actually pleases the end user. HCI methods keep the end user in mind and focus on perfecting the Interaction between the user and the computer or system, as the name suggests. \newline
So to wrap up, the waterfall phases are highly outdated and come with huge risks for the company \citep{ratcliffe2011agile:14}. Some of those phases were improved. Such as iterative design processes and agile development. But both only put focus on their own phase and dictate others \citep{ratcliffe2011agile:22}. In order to improve this process and to actually archive the goal, methods from HCI are needed and have to be integrated and the overall process of creating products has to be modified. \newline
Another big problem is the mentioned little collaboration between Departments \citep{ratcliffe2011agile:fw}. While designers are driven by deadlines and collaborate less with developers, which leads to not viable solutions, developers on the other hand build working software which is no longer valuable to the end user \citep{ratcliffe2011agile:19,ratcliffe2011agile:33}. \newline
Once the Quality Assurance Department, if there is one, has done it's job, the final product gets deployed and only recieves irregular updates \citep{ratcliffe2011agile:18}. This is neither agile nor a sustainable view on digital products. \newline
Requirements will change, theifore the way of reaching a solution must too \citep{ratcliffe2011agile:30:31}.  
\newline \newline 
We still need to keep in mind time, budget and scope of projects. But a subgoal should also be to minimise waste and unused documentation. The Goal will be to bring all together.


% Motivation:
% The product needs to:
% - deliver business value fast, 
% - be technically feasible,
% - and desirable by the end user.
%
% Users get forgotten by the time the product manifests during phases.
% Where is the HCI integreted this far?
%
% Problems:
% Waterfall phases are outdated and to stiff to be actually adhered to
% Some phases are improved
% Design is currently driven by deadlines. Theirby making the sequential process only go forward.
% Designers work mostly seperatly which negates the effects of working agile.
% Expierienced Designers work closly with the customers
% User stories usually indicate a solution => Theirfore limiting the amount of possible solutions
% Once the concept is done by design, development is left with specifications that arent feasible
% The aim of agile is to get to development as quickly as possible 
% without necessarily determining if the concept is feasible.
% The business trusts that Developers have their customers in mind. 
% Just because the software works, that does not mean that the software is valuable to the users
% Developers technological knowledge needs to be shared to all other sections
% Once development and QA are done, the product is left as is and will only get irregular updates
% Agile tries to solve these problemes by working on smaller chunks of work 
% Collaboration was the primary problem. Specialisation wasn't.
% Acceptance criteria needs to be shared more broadly
% Requirements will change, theirfore the way of reaching a solution must too
% Tasks of Roles and roles as such need to be enforced
% The agile movement must continue to innovate and adapt to remain relevant
%
% We still need to keep in mind time, budget and scope of projects. 
% Also minimising waste is part of the improvement
% Goal will be to bring all together
