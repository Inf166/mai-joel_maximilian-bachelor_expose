\section*{Motivation and problems to solve}
% Motivation:
The product needs to:
- deliver business value fast, 
- be technically feasible,
- and desirable by the end user.

Users get forgotten by the time the product manifests during phases.
Where is the HCI integreted this far?

% Problems:
Waterfall phases are outdated and to stiff to be actually adhered to
Some phases are improved
Design is currently driven by deadlines. Theirby making the sequential process only go forward.
Designers work mostly seperatly which negates the effects of working agile.
Expierienced Designers work closly with the customers
User stories usually indicate a solution => Theirfore limiting the amount of possible solutions
Once the concept is done by design, development is left with specifications that arent feasible
The aim of agile is to get to development as quickly as possible 
without necessarily determining if the concept is feasible.
The business trusts that Developers have their customers in mind. 
Just because the software works, that does not mean that the software is valuable to the users
Developers technological knowledge needs to be shared to all other sections
Once development and QA are done, the product is left as is and will only get irregular updates
Agile tries to solve these problemes by working on smaller chunks of work 
Collaboration was the primary problem. Specialisation wasn't.
Acceptance criteria needs to be shared more broadly
Requirements will change, theirfore the way of reaching a solution must too
Tasks of Roles and roles as such need to be enforced
The agile movement must continue to innovate and adapt to remain relevant

We still need to keep in mind time, budget and scope of projects. 
Also minimising waste is part of the improvement
Goal will be to bring all together
