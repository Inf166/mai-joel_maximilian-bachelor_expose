Popular Software Development experts made the agile manifesto and developed the scrum guide. Scrum should be a lightweight wrapper for eXtreme Programming to develop more quality software. Some experts say agile is not the best way to do software development. Some experts say SCRUM is flawed, to begin with. Others see it as lightweight and abstract. Larger Companies are attracted to more cost-efficient ways to develop software but are struggling to change their hierarchy. Finding ways to close the gaps, such as like: 

What are companies struggling with? How can you solve this? Why does SCRUM work at a small scale but is not easily scalable? What solutions are out there? Why is not everybody using them? Does agile even work at larger scales? What needs to be done to become more agile at a large scale?
