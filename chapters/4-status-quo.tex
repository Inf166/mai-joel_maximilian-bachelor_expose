\section*{Status Quo}

17 software development experts wrote the agile manifesto and two of them developed the scrum guide. Scrum should be a lightweight wrapper for eXtreme Programming, an agile approach to writing code, to develop more quality software with less "wasted" time. Some experts state agile is not the single best way for anyone. Some experts state SCRUM is flawed, to begin with. Others see it as lightweight and abstract. Experts from all over the world are trying to solve this knot in the software development community. Larger Companies are attracted to more cost-efficient ways to develop software but are struggling to change their hierarchy. Finding ways to close the gaps, such as like: 

What are companies struggling with? How can you solve this? Why does SCRUM work at a small scale but is not easily scalable? What solutions are out there? Why is not everybody using them? Does agile even work at larger scales? What needs to be done to become more agile at a large scale?
