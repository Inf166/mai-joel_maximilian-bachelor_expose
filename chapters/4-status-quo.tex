\section*{Status Quo}

Currently, it is State of the art to use agile management methods, such as scrum, lean start-up, or design thinking, to generate business value faster, reduce risks, increase flexibility and improve customer satisfaction. \\
Therefore, there are many publications available that discuss integrating user-centered approaches into agile development \citep{PDFAnAgi97:online, HowtoCom22:online} some even going as far as to call it human-centered \citep{Bringing7:online, HumanCen72:online, Forbrig2015ManagingTA, Agilehum49:online}. The difference is, that user-centered is end-user focussed, and human-centered means, keeping the focus on all humans interacting with the system.

As for Human-Computer interaction, the most talked-about strategy is human-centered design, which is similar to an agile iterative process, but it focuses on the humans that will use the final product. Agile Experience Design \citep{ratcliffe2011agile:main} is another strategy that tries to improve on the negatives of agile as it is. \\
Surrounding Human-Computer interaction, the most complete set of methods and strategies as well as recommendations can be received by the DIN Standards Committee Ergonomics on their Norms \citep{dinEnIso9241:110, dinEnIso9241:210, dinEnIso9241:220}. More Information on how to write valuable user stories is found in Jeff Patton's publication "User Story Mapping" \citep{pattonUserStory}. There are still a few publications about the compatibility of HCI and Agile \citep{HumanCom2:online} and Human-Computer Interface expert systems for agile methods \citep{Humancom0:online}.

But none of the above, there is no differentiating between starting a new project and maintaining a product.
