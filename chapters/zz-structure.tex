Intro:
What strategies are there and why don't they work?


Solution:
Differenciating between "A new Project" and "Maintaining a Product"

Key Difference to all before: Human-Centered-Design/Architechture -> Not only think about who will be a Customer but also how the client uses the product 
> a cross-functional team comes together.
> System Architechture before Expierence Design and User Interface Design "Form follows function"
> create just enough of a design vision to get started
> rapid sketching brings the vision to life.
> with a clearer vision we produce, prioritise, and estimate user stories and create a development plan.
> Based on Datasets made by Software Architects, Designers can then create components and modules which result in pages
> detail emerges throughout the development process, directed by the vision.
> somebody on the team has to have the determination to ensure that the design quality stays high.
