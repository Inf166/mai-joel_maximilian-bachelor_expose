% Abstract
% Introduction
%   Motivation
%   What is HCI
%   What is the difference to HCD
%   What is agile and which frameworks are available (Lean Startup, Scrum, etc.)
% Main section
%   The product needs to:
%   - deliver business value fast (Lean Startup), 
%   - be technically feasible (Scrum),
%   - and desirable by the end customer (HCI).
%   Similarities from HCI and agile
%   Previous approaches and why they fail
%     Differenciating between "Starting a Project" and "Maintaining a Product"
%   How can you connect the methods of HCI to agile
%   Rethink the way its done:
%   - User Storys => Business Stories
%   - Concepts start with Datasets made by Software Architects => Feasible Products

% Ideas for Main Section
% 
% Key Difference to all before: 
% > Human-Centered-Design/Architechture -> Not only think about who will be a Customer but also how the client uses the product 
% > a cross-functional team comes together.
% > System Architechture before Expierence Design and User Interface Design "Form follows function"
% > create just enough of a design vision to get started
% > rapid sketching brings the vision to life. => Creates faster value
% > with a clearer vision we produce, prioritise, and estimate user stories and create a development plan.
% > Based on Datasets made by Software Architects, Designers can then create components and modules which result in pages
% > detail emerges throughout the development process, directed by the vision.
% > somebody on the team has to have the determination to ensure that the design quality stays high.
