\section*{Procedure}

% The first step will be to research the available agile frameworks, keeping the focus on the established and mainly used in common working environments. Thereafter, current solutions to the key problems will be analyzed and rated. Following this, it is to decide if further methods are needed, or if the existing ones just have to be modified to accommodate a feasible workflow. All listed methods and strategies will be compared in their benefits and differentiated due to their disadvantages. Next, the decisions have to be made if the set goal of this thesis can be accomplished. Furthermore, the refined methods/tools will be recommended and enhanced by a refined vocabulary based on expert opinions. This toolbox will be additionally added with notes, which are useful for new projects or maintaining an existing product. At last, it is discussed if all gaps were successfully closed, and which are remaining, leading to follow-up projects.
