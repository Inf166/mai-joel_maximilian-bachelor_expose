# Thesis

## How to **overcome** the **theory-practice gap** in the context of the Scrum framework

### Procedure for the empirical thesis

- Proof through evaluation by experts (minimum is 10 to 12)
  - Anna-Carina Kern (Scrum Master)
  - Michael Spiller (SAFe Coach and Consultant)
  - Christian Hinrichsen (???)
  - Mario Hirschfeld (Team Leader and Agile Integrator)
  - ?Stefan Roock
  - ?Marc LÃ¶ffler
- Identify Problems by interviewing experts
- Small Study by asking experts what guidelines or recommendationas are wrong or missing
- Possibly a case study on a client project
- Evaluate Studies by critical analysis of experts
- Why would the model be better due to my guidelines
- Why would it be better due to the integration of upfront design
  - using only generic motives as arguments for the integration

### Problems to solve

- The Team needs to have a common goal
  - Dependencies between team members have to be noticable due to them needing each other
  - Team Members need to know each other in order to understand each other
  - Riskmanagement in the higher management. How to decide on what risks to take and what not.
  - Higher Management needs to live agile as well
  - Company needs to "let go" of the old way and needs to actually do something for being agile
  - Scrumfall (SCRUM + Waterfall). Let go of classical deadline way and write offers in an agile manner and sell iterations
  - Big-Bang Method. No company can become agil with a bang. Its a process.
  - Curiosity instead of threat. Employees have to be interested into agile methods and not be threatend to implement these
  - Poor Scrum Master. Scrum Masters have to be agile integrators that can not only be a scrum master to the development team but also the contact point for higher management and help integrating agile methods
  - Filling key positions incorrectly
  - the influence of any external consultant is limited
  - Prioritization of the backlog incorrect or non-existent
  - No Decisionmaking on Tasks on how to priorizing them, because each person had their own vision and pursued their own interests or goals
  - Missunderstanding Agile: Agile does not resolve hierarchy but instead adds another parallel one
  - How to sort the backlog
  - Agile Work Enviroment - no stationary seating. Scribble on walls by using post its
  - Personal Change for Executives - no need for command and control, because teams are self-organized
  - Handover to other departments suffer loss of information
  - Constant management intervention and costly controlling are equally incompatible with agile philosophies
  - Knowing the Context in which the product currently is. Doing Maintenence tasks only when its also plausible to them right now not while showing clients the product
  - Agile, however, does not save an endangered delivery date of a previously classic project.
  - Integration ends with the introduction of a Framework
  - Missing Feedbackloops to optimize the agile integration
  - Build, Measure Cycle missing

### Problem fields

- Executives/Higher Management
  - Riskmanagement in the higher management. How to decide on what risks to take and what not.
  - Higher Management needs to live agile as well
  - Company needs to "let go" of the old way and needs to actually do something for being agile
  - Curiosity instead of threat. Employees have to be interested into agile methods and not be threatend to implement these
  - the influence of any external consultant is limited
  - Missunderstanding Agile: Agile does not resolve hierarchy but instead adds another parallel one
  - Personal Change for Executives - no need for command and control, because teams are self-organized
  - Constant management intervention and costly controlling are equally incompatible with agile philosophies

- Employees/Team Members
  - Everybody has to be interested to learn more about the agile way
  - Team Members have to meet the required intrinsic motivation for agile methods to work
  - There should be some sort of reward for agile teams to help with motivation
  - The Team needs to have a common goal
  - Dependencies between team members have to be noticable due to them needing each other
  - Team Members need to know each other in order to understand each other
  - Knowing the Context in which the product currently is. Doing Maintenence tasks only when its also plausible to them right now not while showing clients the product
  - Align the personal goal with the companies one

- Client
  - There are no "Architects" on the client side (Understanding the product that should be created)
  - Clients do not want to pay for concept workshops

- Understanding Agile
  - Agile, however, does not save an endangered delivery date of a previously classic project.
  - Understanding the Need for the Role "Architect" in the Role Developer
  - Understanding the Need for the Role "Requirement Engineer" in the Role Architect
  - Understanding the Need for the Role "Agile Integrator"/Scrum Master and setting a Budget for intern Meetings and Workshop
  - Filling key positions incorrectly
  - Continous Learning: Passive learning does not meet the agile way of thinking

- Integration of Agile
  - In order to integrate agile frameworks companies need to test their readiness for agile
  - There has to be some sort of homework/consequences for companies to require the readiness
  - Meeting the Requirements for agile frameworks to work
  - To fully Integrate the agile way and to overlook these processes, the role of the agile integrator/Scrum Master is needed
  - Scrumfall (SCRUM + Waterfall). Let go of classical deadline way and write offers in an agile manner and sell iterations
  - Big-Bang Method. No company can become agil with a bang. Its a process.
  - Poor Scrum Master. Scrum Masters have to be agile integrators that can not only be a scrum master to the development team but also the contact point for higher management and help integrating agile methods
  - Prioritization of the backlog incorrect or non-existent
  - No Decisionmaking on Tasks on how to priorizing them, because each person had their own vision and pursued their own interests or goals
  - How to sort the backlog
  - Agile Work Enviroment - no stationary seating. Scribble on walls by using post its
  - Handover to other departments suffer loss of information
  - Integration ends with the introduction of a Framework
  - Missing Feedbackloops to optimize the agile integration
  - Build, Measure Cycle missing

## How to argue the **necessity** of upfront design, conception in the context of Scrum also **to clients**

### Procedure for the literature thesis

- Proof through literature
- Identify Problems by reading most papers
