# What is Agile?

## Agile is a Culture based on Trust

- Agile Manifesto:
  - Individuals and Interactions over processes and tools
    - No need for Tools that support waterfall like jira etc
    - Not based on the assumption that you know everything upfront
    - Clients know what they want, when they have something in their hands
    - Miro Boards etc are infeirior to upfront eye to eye communication and post its
    - Clients have to be present to ask questions and answer them quickly
    - The project teams sits together in a room and talks
  - Working Software over documentation
    - Any Paperwork that does not provide value to the client is unnesseary
    - If nobody reads it, dont write it
    - #NoWaste
  - Customer Collaboration over Contract Negotiation
    - Customers dont no what is hard to do
    - Therefore they are asking for undoable things
    - Because you discuss the budget and time for the whole project and not for some parts
    - negotiations go nowhere
  - Responding to Change over Following a Plan
    - Dont do Retrospectives - do it on the spot
    - If something does not work - fix it
- Agile Principles:
  - "Once the SCRUM starts, there will be no changes"
    - Bullshit, stuff changes all the time
  - The Teams works together on the daily basis
    - They sit together not share memos back and forth
  - The Individuals are more important than anything
    - If they need to go on a conference - they do not have to ask for permission
      - BASED on TRUST
  - The Teams themselve have to organize them self
    - The Team has to pick the members they want to work with
- Eventually non-agile Companies will cease to exist

## No Estimates

- Estimates are Guesses
  - Guesses are always wrong
  - Provide no value
- Deadlines and Milestones + Local Benefits
  - Are made to make us work overtime
- Chaos report
  - 80% of Software Projects fail
    - because their estimates are wrong
- User Stories
  - Is a narritive not a disguised functional requirement
  - Story Points
    - Dont estimate time
    - estimate difficulty levels that are not easily convertibale into time
- Rituals can be damaging
  - Like doing estimates
- Fear
  - No one wants to invest a million dollars if i do not know
    - Dont build the whole product, just a month long and adjust budget accordingly
      - Brings accurate projections
      - Brings the chance early to fix things
- Backlog
  - First 10 Stories are probably correct
    - Estimation here is waste, because they will be done in no time
  - Next 30 Stories will most likly change but are somewhat correct
    - Estimates here are based on incorrectly assumptions
  - Next 80 Stories are wild fantasy
    - Because you will learn so much from the first 40 that they will most likly not be correct anymore
- Lean Manufacturing
  - The developers control time
    - not the managers
  - The Business side decides what to build
    - Management becomes a support role
      - Take away all obsticalse to work
- Everything that does not put value into your customers hands is waste
  - Estimates are gone
  - Projections have to be done
    - Measure the size and the date of the backlog
    - Measure the size and the date of the done stories
      - Where the lines cross, that is an almost accurate projection into the future of the project
    - Story Points in the fibunacci scale are kind of right because if you think of something as harder, its probably a lot harder
      - But Interestingly if you set the points for all stories to one
      - The Projection is almost the same
    - Also: If the crossing is to far out - adding more people or killing the project is an good idea
    - Using story points actually results in a prediction that is up to 20% wrong while counting stories is only 4% wrong
      - After just 5 Sprints

- Prioritize
  - Story Map
    - Epics on Top
    - User Activities below
    - Stories below them organized in priority order
  - Woring horizontaly across the map starting with the firsts story going down the row
  - Afterwards you have a releaseable product
  - How to handle changes in the map?
    **- Always do the most important things first!**
    - This is a tool for the managers to work with an plan releases
    - Responding to Change over Following a Plan

## Nice Quotes

- Adding people later makes the project even later

## What is User-Experience

- Observe the users and not make estimates or guesses
