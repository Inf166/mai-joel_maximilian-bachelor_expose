# Why SCRUM and Agile are broken

- XP works fine without Scrum
- Scrum was evented or pushed as a wrapper for xp
  - to make it more palettable for project management
- Scrum without XP does not work
- original intend:
  - make it more acceptable for people who wants to become agile
  - if you focus on scrum you miss the goal of becoming agile
- How agile is something you just copy or take from somebody else
  - Stating here, that just applying frameworks without thought is wrong
- As soon as money gets involved, everything becomes corrupted
- Agile is the next important step for software development
- Agile is an evolutionary process
  - there is no certenty
  - no 100% estimation
  - no 100% vision upfront
- People who fear missing estimates
  - Tell them that they will see first results in two weeks
  - the most important stuff is done early on
  - they can tell much earlier if a projects needs to be adjusted
- Agile is a system that encompasses the whole organisation
- Crossfuntional Teams are needed for agile, no departments
- As long as you tell your employees what to do, they cannot do stuff on their own
- If people are unhappy, you are doing it not right
- Accelerate Metrics are indirect indicators
  - Low Deployment Frequency does not mean slow workers
  - Management needs to understand how lean works
  - High Deployment Frequency does not mean good development
  - It can mean push garbidge faster out
- Lean Thinking is about running a factory
  - Dora Metrics / Lean
- Kanban suggests that you are working in a liniar way and there is no going back
  - As soon as you find Problems you fix them, don't wait for retros
- Leadership != Management
- Becoming agile
  - Spend one week looking around
  - Speek with the employees what their problems are
  - List all Problems, also how bad they are
  - Fix one Problem at a time
- How not to become agile
  - Not with a Hammer on top
- Agile Transformation Process != Lean Thinking
  - Lean: Teams find ways to work more efficient
  - Agile Transformation: Frameworks are applied on teams
- As soon as you tell people how to do thinks, you fail
- You need to train people to make good decisions
  - And allowing them to make decisions (HARD PART FOR MANAGEMENT)
- If you do that, you are gonna have something that works in your company
  - It will probably not work anywhere else
- Agile is a selforganized Team seflorganizing
- Backlogs, Sprints etc is stuff that was added later, and not part of the agile manifesto
- Back in the day, a month was a good idea to wait till deployment, today nobody would agree with that
- CONTINOUS IMPROVEMENT
  - How can we make things better
- [](https://holub.com/heuristics/)
  - Without psychological safety, respect, and trust, none of the following is possible.
  - The way we work, the work we do, and the organizations within which we work are all part of a connected system. You cannot change anything without changing everything. You cannot improve a system by tinkering with the parts.
  - Process exists in service of people; the people come first. Processes not developed by the people who use them rarely work well, if at all.
  - The best ways to work are collaborative. Negotiation is not collaboration. Isolated individuals making heroic efforts are never as effective as collaborative groups. We get the best results when customers, business people, and developers literally work together.
  - Welcome change—in organizations, processes, products, plans—at any time. You cannot be simultaneously rigid and agile.
  - Outcomes matter more than output. A focus on output yields sub-par outcomes.
  - Knowledge work has unique concerns, unrelated to those of a factory or construction site.
  - The most effective organizations are learning organizations. Learning—about both the products we produce and the way we produce them—is continuous. Learning is not just a normal work activity, it is the work.
  - We continuously improve by observing how we work and fixing any problems we encounter. Improvement is an ongoing, not a periodic, activity. When something goes wrong, we pause and figure out a way to improve our process so the problem can’t happen again. We focus on the system, not the people. Occasionally, we’ll stop and reflect on our work to make proactive improvements.
  - Simplicity is essential. This rule applies to everything from organizational structure and process to the fine details of the products we develop. We do not waste time building (products or organizations or details) for a future we cannot predict.
  - Work is transient. We expect to change, or even discard, everything we build, from products to organizations and processes. Everything is an experiment.
  - We work to make our customer’s lives better and their work easier. We do that by providing a steady stream of artifacts and aid that they find valuable.
  - We think holistically. We work on complete products, not projects. If you have no projects, you have no need for project management.
  - At the core of our way of working is continuous and rapid feedback. We make a small change, deliver the result into our customer’s hands, get feedback, then adjust what we do based on that feedback. That cycle is as short as possible—minutes, hours, occasionally a few days—not weeks. This inspect-and-adapt loop applies to both process improvement and product development. The changes we deliver are high quality (e.g. in code: no known defects, production ready, secure, &c.).
  - Quality is not negotiable. (This rule applies to all aspects of quality, not just testing.)
  - The best plans are strategic, not tactical.
  - Predictions are unreliable. Estimates are not promises.
  - Our only measure of progress is delivering into our customers hands things they find valuable. It’s okay if they change their minds.
  - Management provides strategic guidance and support only. Tell the teams what you need, trust them to figure out how to execute.
  - Give people the environment and support they need, then get out of the way. We trust autonomous teams to control the way they work and the environment they work in. Teams are self organizing and self managing. They choose their own tools and methods. We expect them to change both the product and themselves as they deem necessary. If all the teams are working in the same way—using the same process or framework, for example—you have no autonomy.
  - Autonomy does not mean that the teams do not coordinate with one another and with the larger organization. Alignment around everything from strategic goals to implementation technology is essential.
  - The best teams are stable. Bring work to the teams; do not form teams to do the work. Fund the teams, not the work.
  - Teams that depend on other teams cannot respond fast enough, so team members have between them all skills needed to get an idea into our customers hands. Skills overlap, so no single person is essential.
  - People must start every day refreshed, relaxed, and able to do their best work (and stop when those conditions no longer hold).
  - Relatedness, autonomy, mastery, and purpose are essential drivers. Rewards and punishments are actively destructive.
  - Communication is central to effective outcomes. Communication effectiveness improves with the degree of physical proximity and the richness of the communication media. Face to face in real time is best, though not always possible, so we sometimes approximate that as best we can.
  - Much of the dysfunction in managment comes from fear, which in turn comes from a lack of transparency. Our processes must be as transparent as possible.

  - We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:
    - Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
    - Working software over comprehensive documentation
    - Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
    - Responding to change over following a plan
- If you dont have smart, skilled and motivated Teammembers,
  - You need to make them more capable
- Feature-Branching is a Team having trust-issues
  - Gatekeeping
- The Team should hire people
  - The HR Team cannot validade if somebody is qualified, because their decisions is based on the little input they were given by others
  - If they let somebody test work for a day, thats agile and ok
    - Is this someone I can learn from
    - It does not matter if they know everthing
    - but if they are willing to learn, thats valuable
- You need to let people to learn
- Also let people work together to develop social skills in collaboration
- Everybody has to read the manifesto at start
